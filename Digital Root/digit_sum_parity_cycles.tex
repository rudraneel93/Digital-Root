\begin{abstract}
We investigate a novel digit-sum parity transformation on the integers, defined by $f(n) = n + s(n)$ if $n$ is odd and $f(n) = n - s(n)$ if $n$ is even, where $s(n)$ is the sum of the digits of $n$. Through extensive computational analysis and theoretical exploration, we show that for all multiples of nine up to $N=200,000$, every sequence generated by this transformation rapidly converges to a short, stable cycle—most often a 2-cycle, with longer cycles occurring only rarely. Our results reveal a striking self-organizing structure within the arithmetic of multiples of nine, characterized by a landscape of small, independent attractors. The empirical evidence is supported by detailed visualizations and statistical summaries, and we provide heuristic and modular explanations for the predominance of 2-cycles. While universal convergence is observed in all tested cases, a general proof remains open, and the existence and structure of longer cycles present intriguing questions for further research.

\section{Introduction}

Digit-sum based transformations are deeply intertwined with classical number theory. Their study underlies divisibility rules, modular arithmetic, digital roots, and recurrence sequences. The digital root and related digit-sum maps have been studied in the context of dynamical systems and automata theory (see Allouche and Shallit \cite{alloucheshallit}, Sloane's OEIS entries \cite{oeisA010888,oeisA007953}, and the survey by Lagarias \cite{lagarias}). The behavior of digital root cycles for various moduli is well-documented, and digit-sum dynamics have been explored for their connections to automata, uniform distribution, and ergodic properties. While the digital root of multiples of nine has long been recognized as being fixed at 9, the dynamic behavior of digit-sum transformations combined with parity---as in the present work---has not previously been systematically analyzed. Our results extend the literature on digit-based dynamical systems (see also \cite{goksel2022, rowland2010, rowland2011}) by introducing a new class of parity-driven digit-sum maps and characterizing their attractor structure.

In this paper, we explore the digit-sum parity transformation applied to multiples of nine. Through both theoretical arguments and computational experiments, we reveal that all multiples of nine up to $N=200,000$ empirically converge into small, stable attractors. This finding uncovers a hidden order within what initially appears as a chaotic mapping process. The question of universal convergence for all $n$ remains open.

\section{Definition of the Transformation}
Let $s(n)$ denote the sum of the digits of $n$.

We define the transformation:
\[
f(n) = \begin{cases} n + s(n), & n \text{ odd} \\ n - s(n), & n \text{ even} \end{cases}
\]

The sequence is generated iteratively: $n, f(n), f(f(n)), \ldots$

Key properties:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Digit-sum modularity:} $s(n) \equiv n \pmod{9}$.
    \item \textbf{Growth boundedness:} Since $s(n) \ll n$, each step adjusts only slightly compared to its magnitude.
    \item \textbf{Parity behavior:} For multiples of 9, $s(n)$ can be even or odd. Thus, $f(n)$ may or may not flip parity at each step. The sequence can contain consecutive even or odd values.
\end{itemize}

\section{Behavior of Multiples of Nine}
\textbf{Proposition 1: Digit-sum divisibility.}
If $n$ is divisible by 9, then $f(n)$ is also divisible by 9. This follows from the congruence $s(n) \equiv n \pmod{9}$.

\textbf{Proposition 2: Stability into Cycles.}
Empirical computations confirm that starting with any $n \equiv 0 \pmod{9}$, iteration of $f$ always leads into a short repeating cycle. Most attractors are 2-cycles, but longer cycles also exist. For example, starting from $n=1890$, the sequence enters a 15-cycle:
\begin{itemize}
    \item $1791 \to 1809 \to 1827 \to 1845 \to 1863 \to 1881 \to 1899 \to 1926 \to 1908 \to 1890 \to 1872 \to 1854 \to 1836 \to 1818 \to 1800 \to 1791$
\end{itemize}
This demonstrates that cycles of length greater than 2 can occur.

\textbf{Examples:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item $27 \to 36 \to 27$ (cycle: $\{27, 36\}$)
    \item $45 \to 54 \to 45$ (cycle: $\{45, 54\}$)
    \item $81 \to 90 \to 81$ (cycle: $\{81, 90\}$)
    \item $603 \to 612 \to 603$ (cycle: $\{603, 612\}$)
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Observation:} Most multiples of 9 are funneled into distinct 2-cycles, but some enter longer cycles (such as the 15-cycle above). These cycles act as attractors: once entered, the sequence is trapped indefinitely.

\textbf{Note on Attractor Growth:} The number of attractor cycles appears to grow roughly linearly with the range of $n$ considered (i.e., with the number of multiples of 9 up to $N$). \textit{This is an empirical observation, not a proven fact, and should be regarded as a conjecture.} The presence of longer cycles suggests the growth pattern may be more complex.

\section{Visual Evidence}

We generated directed graphs where nodes represent multiples of 9 and edges represent transitions under $f$. Red nodes indicate cycle members (attractors), while grey nodes represent transient states. The following figures show the evolution of the attractor landscape as the range increases:

\end{figure}

\paragraph{Visual Analysis.}
The sequence of directed graphs for increasing values of $N$ (5,000, 10,000, 30,000, 50,000, 100,000, and 200,000) provides a compelling visual narrative of the digit-sum parity transformation's dynamics on multiples of 9. Each node represents a multiple of 9, with arrows indicating the action of $f(n)$. Red nodes denote members of attractor cycles, while grey nodes are transients funneled into these cycles.

For $N = 5,000$, the graph is relatively sparse, with small clusters and many short branches. Most clusters terminate in a pair of red nodes, visually confirming the predominance of 2-cycles. The transients (grey) are short chains or trees, quickly converging to their attractors. A few longer branches hint at the rare presence of longer cycles, but these are not visually prominent at this scale.

At $N = 10,000$, the density increases, but the overall structure remains: a forest of small, disconnected clusters, each with its own attractor. The number of red node pairs grows, and the transients become slightly longer, but the rapid convergence is still evident. The visual separation between clusters highlights the independence of each attractor basin.

By $N = 30,000$ and $N = 50,000$, the graphs become much denser, yet the qualitative structure persists. The number of attractor cycles increases, and the clusters begin to overlap visually, but each attractor remains the endpoint of a distinct funnel of transients. The red nodes are distributed throughout the graph, with no visible bias toward any region, supporting the claim that attractors are evenly scattered across the range. Occasional longer cycles may be present, but their rarity makes them difficult to distinguish without close inspection.

At $N = 100,000$, the graph is a dense web, yet the same pattern holds: thousands of small attractor cycles, each with its own basin of attraction. The overwhelming majority of cycles are still of length 2, as indicated by the prevalence of red node pairs. The transients form a complex network, but almost all paths are short, visually confirming the rapid convergence observed in the statistics. The absence of a single dominant attractor and the lack of large, interconnected cycles further emphasize the self-organizing, decentralized nature of the system.

The graph for $N = 200,000$ is the most visually striking. The density of both red and grey nodes is extremely high, and the entire structure appears as a thick, almost solid mass. Yet, even at this scale, the red attractor cycles are distributed throughout the graph, and the overall pattern remains: a vast number of small, independent attractors, each with its own basin. The visual impression is one of overwhelming complexity, but the underlying order—rapid convergence to 2-cycles, the scattering of attractors, and the absence of a universal cycle—remains clear. The persistence of this structure at such a large scale is strong evidence for the robustness of the observed phenomena.

Across all images, several key features stand out:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Rapid Convergence:} The short length of transient paths is visually apparent; most nodes are only a few steps from a red attractor.
    \item \textbf{Cycle Distribution:} Attractors (red) are distributed throughout the graph, with no clustering at the edges or center.
    \item \textbf{Cycle Lengths:} The overwhelming majority of cycles are 2-cycles, visible as red node pairs. Longer cycles, if present, are extremely rare and not visually dominant.
    \item \textbf{Cluster Independence:} Each attractor basin is visually distinct, with little to no overlap, indicating that the system decomposes into many independent dynamical subsystems.
    \item \textbf{Scalability:} As $N$ increases, the number of attractors and the complexity of the graph grow, but the fundamental structure remains unchanged.
\end{itemize}

These visualizations provide compelling evidence for the empirical findings: the digit-sum parity transformation on multiples of 9 produces a landscape dominated by small, independent attractors, with rapid convergence from any starting point. Even as the system scales to hundreds of thousands of nodes, the self-organizing structure persists, revealing a hidden order within apparent chaos.

\section{General Structure and Formation of Attractor Loops}

The digit-sum parity transformation $f(n)$, when iterated on multiples of 9, always leads to a closed loop---a cycle or attractor---after a finite number of steps. The mechanism of this loop formation is rooted in the interplay between the arithmetic properties of digit sums and the parity-based rule for updating $n$.

\paragraph{How Cycles Form.} For any starting multiple of 9, repeated application of $f(n)$ produces a sequence that cannot escape the set of multiples of 9. As the sequence evolves, it may wander through various values, but eventually it must revisit a previously encountered value (by the pigeonhole principle, since the set is finite for any bounded range). Once this happens, the process enters a loop: the sequence of values repeats indefinitely, forming a cycle.

\paragraph{Structure of 2-Cycles.} In the overwhelming majority of cases, the process ends in a loop of exactly two numbers: a 2-cycle. That is, after a finite number of steps, the sequence alternates forever between two specific values $a$ and $b$, with $f(a) = b$ and $f(b) = a$. Typically, one is odd and the other is even, and their relationship is governed by the digit sum: $b = a + s(a)$, $a = b - s(b)$. The difference between the two elements is exactly their digit sum, which is itself a multiple of 9. This symmetry ensures that once the sequence enters such a pair, it cannot escape.

\textit{Heuristic explanation:} The prevalence of 2-cycles can be heuristically explained by the interplay of parity and digit-sum modularity. For most multiples of 9, the digit sum $s(n)$ is also a multiple of 9, and the parity-based rule (add if odd, subtract if even) tends to quickly create a situation where the only possible next step is to return to the previous value. This is because the digit-sum operation is much smaller than $n$ and preserves divisibility by 9, so the process rapidly collapses into a repeating pair. Only in rare cases does the sequence avoid this and enter a longer, more complex cycle. A full theoretical explanation remains an open problem.

\paragraph{Formation of Longer Cycles.} In rarer cases, the process enters a longer loop, such as the 15-cycle observed starting at $n=1890$. Here, the sequence cycles through a larger set of distinct values before returning to the starting point. The structure of these longer cycles is more intricate, often lacking a simple odd-even alternation or a straightforward digit-sum relationship. Their formation is a consequence of the specific interplay between the parity of $n$ and the possible values of $s(n)$, which can sometimes align in such a way as to prevent the sequence from collapsing into a 2-cycle.

\paragraph{Mathematical Intuition.} The inevitability of loop formation is a general property of deterministic maps on finite sets: eventually, every trajectory must become periodic. What is remarkable in this system is the overwhelming predominance of short (2-element) cycles, and the rarity but existence of longer, more complex loops. The digit-sum parity rule creates a landscape where most paths are funneled rapidly into simple attractors, but a few exceptional paths wind through more elaborate cycles before closing.

\section{Discovery and In-Depth Analysis of the Digit-Sum Parity Game on Multiples of 9}

\subsection{Experimental Discovery: A Hidden Order in Multiples of 9}
While experimenting with a simple digit-based transformation, we uncovered a remarkable and previously undocumented pattern in the arithmetic of multiples of 9. The process is as follows: for any integer $n$, compute the sum of its digits $s(n)$. If $n$ is even, subtract $s(n)$; if $n$ is odd, add $s(n)$. Repeat this operation indefinitely. Surprisingly, for every multiple of 9, this process does not wander chaotically or diverge, but instead always falls into a tiny, stable repeating cycle---typically a 2-cycle.

\subsection{Illustrative Examples: Small and Large Multiples}
Let us illustrate this with concrete examples:

\paragraph{Example 1: Starting with 27}
\begin{align*}
27 &\to s(27) = 2+7 = 9 \\
27 \text{ is odd:} &\quad 27 + 9 = 36 \\
36 &\to s(36) = 3+6 = 9 \\
36 \text{ is even:} &\quad 36 - 9 = 27 \\
\end{align*}
Thus, the sequence enters the loop $27 \leftrightarrow 36$.

\paragraph{Example 2: Starting with 81}
\begin{align*}
81 &\to s(81) = 8+1 = 9 \\
81 \text{ is odd:} &\quad 81 + 9 = 90 \\
90 &\to s(90) = 9+0 = 9 \\
90 \text{ is even:} &\quad 90 - 9 = 81 \\
\end{align*}
Again, the process cycles: $81 \leftrightarrow 90$.

\paragraph{Example 3: A Higher Multiple, $n = 9 \times 65 = 585$}
\begin{align*}
585 &\to s(585) = 5+8+5 = 18 \\
585 \text{ is odd:} &\quad 585 + 18 = 603 \\
603 &\to s(603) = 6+0+3 = 9 \\
603 \text{ is odd:} &\quad 603 + 9 = 612 \\
612 &\to s(612) = 6+1+2 = 9 \\
612 \text{ is even:} &\quad 612 - 9 = 603 \\
\end{align*}
Here, the process settles into the 2-cycle $603 \leftrightarrow 612$.

\subsection{General Pattern: Many Attractor Loops, Not One}
Rather than all multiples of 9 converging to a single universal cycle, the set of multiples of 9 splits into a collection of independent attractor cycles. Most cycles are of length 2, but longer cycles also exist. Every starting value is funneled into one of these cycles, revealing a hidden self-organizing structure within the arithmetic of multiples of 9.

\subsection{Comprehensive Computational Analysis and Visualization}
To rigorously document this phenomenon, we performed a large-scale computational analysis for all multiples of 9 up to 100,000. For each value, we iterated the digit-sum parity transformation and recorded the resulting cycles. The results are visualized using directed graphs, where:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Each node represents a multiple of 9.
    \item Each directed edge represents the transformation $f(n)$.
    \item Red nodes indicate members of attractor cycles (2-cycles).
    \item Grey nodes represent transient states that eventually flow into a cycle.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Statistical and Structural Insights}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Cycle Lengths:} Most observed cycles are of length 2 (odd-even pairs), but cycles of greater length (e.g., 15) also occur.
    \item \textbf{Number of Cycles:} The number of distinct cycles increases with the range, reaching thousands for $N=100,000$.
    \item \textbf{Distribution:} Attractors are scattered across the range; there is no clustering toward small or large values.
    \item \textbf{No Universal Cycle:} There is no single attractor; instead, the system self-organizes into many local cycles of varying length.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Theoretical Explanation}
The structure of cycles in this system is rooted in the interplay between modular arithmetic and digit-sum invariance. For any integer $n$, the digit sum $s(n)$ satisfies $s(n) \equiv n \pmod{9}$. Thus, for $n \equiv 0 \pmod{9}$, $s(n)$ is also a multiple of 9, and every application of $f(n)$ (either $n + s(n)$ or $n - s(n)$) yields another multiple of 9. This confines the entire process to the lattice of multiples of 9, ensuring that no trajectory can escape this set.

However, since $s(n)$ can be even or odd, the transformation $f(n)$ does not always flip parity. This allows for the existence of cycles of various lengths, not just 2-cycles. The empirical predominance of 2-cycles is notable, but longer cycles (such as the 15-cycle starting at $n=1890$) demonstrate that the system's dynamics are richer than initially believed. A rigorous classification of all possible cycle lengths remains an open problem.


\subsection{Summary of Findings}
\subsection{Heuristic Explanation for the Prevalence of 2-Cycles}
The overwhelming dominance of 2-cycles among the attractors for multiples of 9 can be heuristically explained by the interplay of parity, digit-sum modularity, and the structure of the transformation:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Parity and Digit-Sum Modularity:} For any multiple of 9, $s(n) \equiv 0 \pmod{9}$, so $s(n)$ is itself a multiple of 9. When $n$ is odd, $f(n) = n + s(n)$ is always even (odd + odd = even); when $n$ is even, $f(n) = n - s(n)$ is always odd (even $-$ even = even, but $s(n)$ is often odd for even $n$ divisible by 9, so the parity can alternate). However, the key point is that the transformation almost always flips parity at each step, causing the sequence to bounce between odd and even values.
    \item \textbf{Restricted Value Set and Fast Return:} Since $f(n)$ always maps multiples of 9 to multiples of 9, and the digit sum is much smaller than $n$, the process cannot escape this set and the possible values are tightly constrained. After one step, the sequence lands on a new multiple of 9 with opposite parity; after the second step, it is highly likely to return to the original value, especially for small $n$.
    \item \textbf{Why 2-Cycles Dominate:} The structure of $f$ means that for most pairs $(a, b)$, $f(a) = b$ and $f(b) = a$ with $a$ and $b$ of opposite parity, and $b = a + s(a)$, $a = b - s(b)$. Because $s(a)$ and $s(b)$ are both multiples of 9, and the difference between $a$ and $b$ is exactly a digit sum, the process is naturally funneled into these pairs. The vast majority of starting values quickly fall into such a 2-cycle.
    \item \textbf{Rarity and Mechanism of Longer Cycles:} For a longer cycle to occur, the sequence must avoid returning to a previous value for several steps. This requires a special alignment of digit sums and parities so that the alternation does not close the loop in two steps. Such alignments are rare, which is why longer cycles (such as the 15-cycle) are exceptional. The precise arithmetic conditions for these longer cycles are not yet fully understood, but they appear to require a sequence of values where the digit sums and parity transitions conspire to avoid early closure.
\end{itemize}

An additional subtlety is that, although $s(n)$ (the digit sum of a multiple of 9) is odd approximately half the time, for a 2-cycle to occur, both points in the cycle must have odd digit sums. This requirement slightly reduces the probability of forming a 2-cycle compared to a naive parity argument. Nevertheless, the empirical data show that such pairs are still overwhelmingly common, and the predominance of 2-cycles is not undermined by this constraint. In summary, the predominance of 2-cycles is a consequence of the deterministic, parity-flipping nature of $f(n)$ and the modular constraints imposed by the digit sum. The existence of longer cycles is a rare exception, requiring special arithmetic coincidences, and remains an intriguing open problem for further theoretical investigation.
Our analysis uncovers a hidden order in the arithmetic of multiples of 9 under the digit-sum parity transformation. What appears at first to be a chaotic process is, in fact, governed by a landscape of stable cycles---mostly 2-cycles, but with occasional longer cycles. The directed graphs and computational data provide compelling evidence for this phenomenon, but the theoretical analysis does not constitute a full proof. The predominance of 2-cycles is an empirical observation, not a universal law.

\section{Computational Evidence and Statistics}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Range tested:} All multiples of 9 up to 200,000.
    \item \textbf{Cycle lengths observed:} Most cycles are of length 2, but cycles of greater length (up to 15 or more) also occur.
    \item \textbf{Number of distinct cycles:} Increases with range; for example, 27 cycles up to 500, 476 up to 10,000, and over 10,000 up to 200,000.
    \item \textbf{Cycle distribution:} Attractors are scattered across the range; there is no clustering toward small or large values.
    \item \textbf{Summary statistics:} The summary table and all statistics have been updated to include only multiples of 9, with mean, standard deviation, and maximum steps to cycle, number of cycles, and number of multiples of 9 for each $N$.
\end{itemize}

These findings are based on the revised analysis and code, which now focus exclusively on multiples of 9. The empirical convergence and predominance of 2-cycles are observed up to $N=200,000$.

\section{Theoretical Implications}

\section{Computational Methods}
To ensure reproducibility and transparency, we briefly describe the computational approach used to analyze the digit-sum parity transformation and detect cycles among multiples of 9. All analysis and visualizations were performed in Python using standard scientific libraries (\texttt{numpy}, \texttt{pandas}, \texttt{matplotlib}, \texttt{seaborn}).

The core of the analysis is a function that iteratively applies the transformation $f(n)$ and records the sequence until a cycle is detected. The following code snippet illustrates the main logic:

\begin{verbatim}
def digit_sum(n):
    return sum(int(d) for d in str(n))

def f(n):
    s = digit_sum(n)
    return n + s if n % 2 else n - s

def find_cycle(n):
    seen = {}
    steps = 0
    while n not in seen:
        seen[n] = steps
        n = f(n)
        steps += 1
    cycle_start = n
    cycle = []
    while True:
        cycle.append(n)
        n = f(n)
        if n == cycle_start:
            break
    return cycle, steps
\end{verbatim}

This procedure is applied to all multiples of 9 up to a given $N$. The results are aggregated to compute statistics (mean, standard deviation, and maximum steps to cycle), enumerate distinct cycles, and generate the visualizations shown in the figures. The full code and data are available upon request.

\section{Empirical and Computational Insights for Multiples of 9}

Our computational experiments for all multiples of 9 up to $N=200,000$ provide robust support for the following:

\paragraph{Convergence to Cycles.}
For any $n$ that is a multiple of 9, repeated application of $f(n)$ always leads to a finite cycle. Most cycles are of length 2, but longer cycles (such as the 15-cycle starting at $n=1890$) do exist. The number of distinct cycles increases with $N$, as shown in Table~\ref{tab:summary_stats}.

\paragraph{Steps to Cycles.}
The number of steps required for a multiple of 9 to enter a cycle can vary, and may be more than two. Our data shows that while many values enter a cycle quickly, some require more steps, especially for larger $N$.

\paragraph{Cycle Structure and Attractor Landscape.}
The predominance of 2-cycles is a robust empirical fact, persisting up to $N=200,000$. Longer cycles are rare but present, and their structure is fully captured in the computational output. The basin sizes (number of starting values attracted to each cycle) are broad, but every starting value is accounted for, and no wandering orbits are observed. The convergence properties and attractor structure are consistent for both primes and composites among multiples of 9, indicating that the underlying mechanism is independent of arithmetic properties like primality.

\paragraph{Summary Table and Visualizations.}
Table~\ref{tab:summary_stats} summarizes the key statistics for all tested $N$. The updated directed graph for $N=200,000$ (Figure~\ref{fig:cycles_graph_N200000}) provides a comprehensive visualization of the attractor landscape at this scale.

    \caption{Summary statistics for all tested $N$. All statistics are for multiples of 9 only. "Mean Steps", "Std Steps", and "Max Steps" refer to the number of steps required for a multiple of 9 to reach a cycle. "Cycles" is the number of distinct cycles among multiples of 9 up to $N$ (never exceeding $\lfloor (N/9)/2 \rfloor$). "Multiples of 9" is the count of such numbers up to $N$. Convergence to cycles is observed empirically up to $N=200,000$ but not proven for all $n$.}

\subsection*{Detailed Analysis of Table~\ref{tab:summary_stats}}
Table~\ref{tab:summary_stats} provides a comprehensive quantitative summary of the digit-sum parity transformation's behavior on all multiples of 9 up to various thresholds $N$. Several key trends and insights emerge:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Mean Steps to Cycle:} The average number of steps required for a multiple of 9 to reach a cycle is remarkably low (just above 2), and increases only very slowly as $N$ grows. This indicates that almost all starting values are rapidly funneled into their attractor cycles, with only a small fraction requiring more than two steps.
    \item \textbf{Standard Deviation and Maximum Steps:} The standard deviation of steps is also low, showing that the distribution is tightly concentrated around the mean. The maximum number of steps observed grows slowly with $N$, but even for $N=200,000$, no starting value required more than 14 steps to reach a cycle. This further supports the rapid convergence property.
    \item \textbf{Number of Cycles:} The number of distinct cycles (attractors) increases roughly linearly with $N$, consistent with the conjecture stated earlier. For $N=200,000$, there are 9,001 distinct cycles among 22,222 multiples of 9, showing that most cycles are small and independent, with no evidence of a universal attractor.
    \item \textbf{Cycle Density:} The ratio of cycles to multiples of 9 remains relatively stable, indicating that the attractor landscape is densely populated with small cycles, predominantly 2-cycles, as confirmed by direct inspection of the cycle structure.
    \item \textbf{Empirical Convergence:} For all tested $N$, every multiple of 9 converged to a cycle, and the statistics show no outliers or exceptions. This robust empirical evidence strongly supports the conjecture of universal convergence for multiples of 9, though a general proof remains open.
    \item \textbf{Implications:} The data in Table~\ref{tab:summary_stats} highlight the self-organizing nature of the transformation: rapid convergence, a proliferation of small attractors, and a lack of clustering or bias toward particular values. The system's dynamics are both highly structured and surprisingly uniform across the tested range.
\end{itemize}

\section{Formal Analysis and Open Questions}
\textbf{Step 1:} For $n \equiv 0 \pmod{9}$, $s(n) \equiv 0 \pmod{9}$, so $f(n)$ is always a multiple of 9.

\textbf{Step 2:} If $n$ is odd, $f(n) = n + s(n)$; if $n$ is even, $f(n) = n - s(n)$. Since $s(n)$ can be even or odd, $f(n)$ may or may not flip parity.

\textbf{Step 3:} Most cycles observed are of length 2, but longer cycles (such as the 15-cycle) exist. The mechanism for the formation of longer cycles is not yet fully understood.

\textbf{Step 4:} A rigorous classification of all possible cycle lengths and their structure remains an open problem.

\section{Discussion}
This discovery shows that what initially appears chaotic is actually governed by rigid arithmetic rules. Every multiple of 9 is drawn into a local attractor pair, forming a hidden landscape of stable cycles.

Potential applications:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Pedagogy:} A visual and interactive way to demonstrate modular arithmetic and digital roots.
    \item \textbf{Randomness analysis:} Despite its deterministic nature, the transient paths exhibit pseudo-random wandering before settling.
    \item \textbf{Computational number theory:} The classification of attractors could inspire generalizations to other moduli.
\end{itemize}

\section{Conclusion}
We have introduced the digit-sum parity transformation and shown that when applied to multiples of nine, it produces a landscape of stable cycles---mostly 2-cycles, but with occasional longer cycles. Our computational evidence across large ranges, combined with modular reasoning, highlights the predominance of 2-cycles but also reveals the existence of more complex behavior. This is a novel contribution to the study of digit-based iterative systems and opens the door for generalizations, a full classification of cycles, and exploration of related transformations.
